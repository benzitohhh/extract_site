## First, make sure wget is installed (i.e. brew install wget)

## Then...

wget \ 
  --mirror \
  --page-requisites \
  --convert-links \
  --span-hosts \
  --domains gadetection.pbworks.com \
  http://gadetection.pbworks.com/w/page/7930628/FrontPage

### Note:
### a) you may need to run a http-server to access the files
### b) you may need to rename a bunch of files as .html (as http-server may serve them without the correct mime type)
